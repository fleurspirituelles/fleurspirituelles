### ¡Hola, amigos!

I'm Talitha, a technology professional dedicated to achieving excellence in software development.

I'm a student at the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of São Paulo, working towards a degree in Systems Analysis and Development. 

I have a solid foundation in core web technologies like CSS, HTML, JavaScript, and TypeScript.

To stay ahead in the field, I'm diving into modern tools and frameworks such as React, Tailwind, SASS, and Styled Components.

In addition to web development, I have hands-on experience with Python, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.
